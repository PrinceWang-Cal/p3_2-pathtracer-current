This check can be done by checking if 1.0 - pow(ior, 2) * (1.0 - pow(cos_theta, 2)) is < 0.\n",

With m = 1, we can already see the room, as light bounces off from the wall and entered the camera. The two spheres are interesting, we can see a portion of light hitting the sphere and bouncing off into the camera, but the majority of it is dark, as our max_ray_depth does not allow light coming off the glass material yet. With m=2, we can now see the reflected spheres, but not the refracted sphere. We begin to see the refracted sphere at m=3, as most light at that sphere bounce on the surface, go through it, and exit toward the camera, needing 3 bounces. At m = 4, we see the reflection of the right sphere inside the left sphere, as we have allowed one more bounce. Beyond m=5, we don't see much difference."
